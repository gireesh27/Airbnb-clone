## Project Overview

## Backend (Django REST Framework)
### API Endpoints
#### 1. GET API
- Retrieves Airbnb listing data from the MySQL database and returns it as a response.

#### 2. POST API
- Accepts a request to insert new Airbnb listing data into the MySQL database.

#### 3. Additional APIs
- More endpoints can be added as needed for extended functionalities.

## Scraper (Scrapy)
A Scrapy-based web scraper is implemented to gather Airbnb listings directly from the Airbnb website.

### Data Fields Collected
The scraper extracts the following details from Airbnb listings:
- Listing Title
- Location
- Address
- Price per night
- Currency
- Total Price
- Image URLs
- Ratings
- Description
- Number of Reviews
- Available Amenities
- Host Information
- Property Type

### Input Parameters
- Location
- Check-in Date
- Check-out Date
- Number of Guests

### Handling Pagination & API Calls
- The scraper is designed to handle pagination effectively.
- It identifies and utilizes Airbnb’s API calls to optimize data retrieval.

### POST Request to Backend
Once the scraper gathers listing data, it sends a POST request to the Django backend to store it in the MySQL database.

#### Example API Call:
```python
import requests

data = {
    "title": "Cozy Apartment in NYC",
    "location": "New York, USA",
    "price_per_night": 120,
    "ratings": 4.8,
    "reviews": 150,
    "amenities": ["WiFi", "Kitchen", "Air Conditioning"],
    "host": {...},
    # other fields here
}

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/add_listing", json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```
